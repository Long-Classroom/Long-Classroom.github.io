         <p style="color:black;">One of the first sports I ever played was soccer. At first it was simple, kick the ball and get it in the goal. But, when you think about it, gravity does everything. In that split second when your foot hits the ball you’re generating the speed that is necessary to put the precise amount of force on the ball that will get it to the goal. The ball is dragging on the ground, friction slowing it down little by little. When you shoot a ball to the top of the goal you are defying gravity, the ball in a weightless free fall, void of the resistance that the grass gives. The amount of force you apply on the ball is enough to break bones. Your brain can seamlessly calculate the exact amount of speed that you need to apply on the ball to make it go the distance to the goal. In soccer everyone is constantly fighting the force that holds us to the ground.</p>

         <p style="color:black;">Dance uses a lot of gravity, and it is also one of my favorite sports. In pointe you use gravity for a lot of things, you are applying too much pressure to your  4 joints that you use whenever you are on point. People sprain their ankles because they apply so much pressure to their feet. There is not just gravity in pointe there is also gravity in every kind of dance. When you dance you use resistance a whole lot whenever you kick, or when you jump, you use resistance by squeezing everything in your body. You also use movement in dance, everything you do in dance is movement. Next, you use speed, force, and distance when you dance, for an example, when you are going to do a leap then you need a lot of distance, force, and speed to get up in the air. When you leap then you use free fall whenever you are coming down. You want to feel weightless when you dance because then you don’t make loud noises and you can do everything better if you are weightless. There are so many more reasons for why gravity is used in dance.</p>

         <p style="color:black;">My favorite thing to do is to play football. Football defines gravity by using force, speed, movement, weight, and even sometimes free fall. These concepts all come into place by throwing the ball, running the ball, blocking, and even trying to get past the blocks. Throwing the ball, you have to use force and movement to know when to throw it and how to throw it. For running the ball you have to use force, speed, and movement for how fast to run it and also how to get past the other team. Blocking and getting pasted the blockers you have to use force, weight, movement, and speed to be able to not let them get through and to stay with them.</p>

         <p style="color:black;">When I play on the Wii U, I use force to pick it up. Then in the game I use speed and mass to calculate when to jump or jump higher. I use pressure when I'm moving the controls. Then I always plan the distance to know where I'm landing. When it jumps it has a free fall for 2 seconds then goes down. But it's not because of the weight. It's because its gravity pulling down at the same time, but there is a little resistance when it's jumping. When I'm bouyancy in the water I'm going down instead of up so I have to use force to float up.</p>

         <p style="color:black;">I like to draw alot, although I’m not very good at it.  The movement of my wrist going back and forth, up and down.  Without gravity on earth, this activity would be very hard to do.  Our markers would be floating in space and when we would try to draw, our paper would move somewhere else. They would never stay in one place. The paper you're drawing on doesn’t have a big amount of mass, but tons of resistance, so it falls at a slower rate than most objects.  Every time your marker comes in contact with your paper, it causes friction.  Friction has made our artworks beautiful. Without friction, our marker would never touch our paper, thus leaving it blank...forever. </p>
